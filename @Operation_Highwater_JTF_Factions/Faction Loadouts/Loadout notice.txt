As it has been stated before this mod was made for the Roleplay server Operation Highwater,
and therefore the gear on the loadouts use them, before using the factions do the following:
1. Install Tactical Flava (TF) and Forward Operators Gear (FOG) on your server. 
2. Alternatively change the items on the loadouts in the loadouts .json files.
3. Make sure all the loadout files are in your loadouts folder, unless you are only using 1 faction,
then you only need to put that factions loadout in your loadouts folder.

Note that the Loadouts, especially the Infantry/Riflemen ones have had issues spawning with their guns in the past.
Also note that I may forget to remove the numbers so you may need ton remove the numbers from the loadout file names.
